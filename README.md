Sublime Text 2
==============

First of all this just will be a backup-thing for my Sublime Text 2 settings. 
Feel free to grab it with all key bindings or whatever. 
If there's a demand for further information I'll update this readme here where you can find specific settings. 

Right now I've the following Packages installed

```
		"Git",
		"LastModifiedIndicator",
		"Neon Theme",
		"Package Control",
		"Sass",
		"SASS Snippets",
		"Search Stack Overflow",
		"Search WordPress Codex",
		"Theme - Flatland",
		"Wordpress"
```
